# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 

### Purpose

Having researched  what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA, we've be asked to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked our team to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The results of our unsupervised learning analysis and resulting data visualizations will be shared with the board.
